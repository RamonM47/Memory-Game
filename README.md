# Next steps/ improvements:

This code is pretty stiff and has alot of hard coded elements that make it hard to manipulate the way i want to. Next time will use more dom manipulation.

# Missing features:

- Cards facing up for a short time in the beginning.

- A different message upon re-start.

- A shuffle function that would shuffle the cards.

- Animations of the cards flipping.
