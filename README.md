Memory-Game : A card game where you guess where the card pairs are.

Getting Started;

The Game begins as soon as the browser opens, once you click the first card, it is your job to find where the matching pair is!

Next steps/ improvements:
This code is pretty stiff and has alot of hard coded elements that make it hard to manipulate the way i want to. Next time will use more dom manipulation.
Missing features:

Cards facing up for a short time in the beginning.

A different message upon re-start.

A shuffle function that would shuffle the cards.

Animations of the cards flipping.
